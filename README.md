Project Title - Bulldog Life Expectancy Analysis

Team Members - Parth Korat, Geoff Pawlowski, Ashutosh Sawant

Research Question to Answer - What is a better societal indicator of life expectancy; access basic infrastructure services, access to healthcare, or access to education?

Project Description/Outline:

Longer life; this is a universal goal that the world’s countries have been trying to achieve for its peoples’ since countries first came to be.  The good news is that the world has been wildly successful at extending life over the past two (2) centuries.  The more inconclusive news is that different countries have achieved varying results over time.  This is not unexpected as different countries develop at different rates.  Figure 1 is just one (1) example of how two countries can have very different life expectancy curves, relative to time.  However, with many datasets available to us at this time in history, we are hoping to take advantage of the stratification in life expectancy between countries and several other quantifiable variables.  By measuring the correlation between the countries and these variables, we hope to identify the strongest societal indicators of life expectancy.  Our focus in this project is researching variables within three societal factors:  access to basic infrastructure services, access to healthcare, and access to education.
